You are generating a list of DevelopmentCard JSON objects using structured outputs.

Scenario Context:
{{ scenario_injection or "(none)" }}

Stage:
{{ stage | tojson }}

Prior summary:
{{ prior_summary | tojson }}

Allowed tags:
{{ tags | join(", ") }}

Beat plan (one card per beat, in order):
{{ beats | tojson }}

Required card ids (use these verbatim, in order):
{{ card_ids | tojson }}

Output JSON schema:
{
  "cards": [
    {
      "id": "string",
      "stage": 0,
      "title": "string",
      "short_description": "string",
      "description": "string",
      "valence": "positive|negative|mixed",
      "arrows_up": 0,
      "arrows_down": 0,
      "severity": 1,
      "tags": ["string"],
      "thread_id": "string",
      "supersedes": "string or null",
      "activation": {
        "type": "immediate|conditional",
        "required_policy_tags": ["string"]
      },
      "effects": [
        {"type": "DRAW_DEV_NOW", "params": {"count": 2, "stage_offset": 0}}
      ],
      "art_prompt": "string",
      "suggested_visibility": "faceup|facedown|either"
    }
  ]
}

Constraints:
- Produce exactly one card per beat, in the same order as card_ids.
- Keep outcomes grounded and stage-appropriate; avoid sci-fi leaps.
- Use 1-3 tags per card from the allowed list.
- Respect any special_directive in the beat object (e.g., supersedes, conditional, powerup, quantitative_indicator).
- For supersedes: reference a prior-stage card id when possible (provided in the beat).
- For conditional: set activation.type=conditional and include at least one required_policy_tags item.
- For powerup: include a non-empty effects list with meaningful parameters.
- For quantitative_indicator: include at least one numeric indicator in the short_description (e.g., "+1.5%" or "3x").
- art_prompt should be a concise instruction for a horizontal card illustration (no need to include title text here; it will be added later).

Example (single card shown):
{
  "cards": [
    {
      "id": "dev_stage0_local_office_ai_copilots",
      "stage": 0,
      "title": "Copilots Spread Across Office Work",
      "short_description": "Early productivity gains (+1.2%) appear in high-income service roles.",
      "description": "AI copilots become standard in finance and legal workflows, raising output per worker. Firms reinvest savings into new AI tooling rather than hiring. Wage gaps widen between AI-augmented and non-augmented roles.",

      "arrows_up": 2,
      "arrows_down": 1,
      "severity": 3,
      "tags": ["productivity_growth", "wage_dispersion"],
      "thread_id": "office_copilots",
      "supersedes": null,
      "activation": {"type": "immediate", "required_policy_tags": []},
