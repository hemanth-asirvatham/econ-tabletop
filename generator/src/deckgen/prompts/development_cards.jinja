You are generating a list of DevelopmentCard JSON objects using structured outputs.

Scenario Context:
{{ scenario_injection or "(none)" }}

Stage:
{{ stage | tojson }}

Simulation outline:
{{ outline_text }}

Allowed tags:
{{ tags | join(", ") }}

Beat plan (one card per beat, in order):
{{ beats | tojson }}

Required card ids (use these verbatim, in order):
{{ card_ids | tojson }}

Output JSON schema:

Constraints:
- Produce exactly one card per beat, in the same order as card_ids.
- Generate the full stage in one response; do not split or stream per-card outputs.
- Keep outcomes mutually exclusive within the stage: avoid duplicate or near-duplicate developments and effects.
- Keep outcomes grounded and stage-appropriate; avoid sci-fi leaps.
- Use the simulation outline to maintain an optimistic skew and stage-appropriate progressions.
- Use 1-3 tags per card from the allowed list.
- Title: 2-4 words, simple and punchy (no subtitle, no colon).
- short_description: <= 60 characters; minimalist summary.
- description: 1 short sentence, <= 140 characters total.
- Respect any special_directive in the beat object (e.g., supersedes, conditional, powerup, quantitative_indicator).
- For supersedes: reference a prior-stage card id when possible (provided in the beat).
- For conditional: set activation.type=conditional and include at least one required_policy_tags item.
- For powerup: include a non-empty effects list with meaningful parameters.
- For powerup: include an explicit imperative rule sentence in the description (e.g., "Draw 2 development cards now.").
- For conditional: include a brief conditional clause in the description.
- Include at least 2 powerup cards per stage; prioritize common powerups:
  - Research acceleration: draw and play 2 development cards from the next stage (DRAW_DEV_NEXT_STAGE_NOW + count 2).
  - Research slowdown: remove the two highest-impact development cards from the next stage (express as a rule sentence; approximate by MODIFY_DEV_DRAW_NEXT_ROUND -2).
  - Policy bandwidth shifts: modify next round policy draw or max policies by ±1.
- Effects vocabulary (use one or two max):
  - DRAW_DEV_NOW {count, stage_offset}: immediately reveal additional development cards this round.
  - DRAW_DEV_NEXT_STAGE_NOW {count}: immediately reveal cards from the next stage.
  - MODIFY_DEV_DRAW_NEXT_ROUND {delta}: increase/decrease next round's development draw (research acceleration/slowdown).
  - MODIFY_POLICY_DRAW_NEXT_ROUND {delta}: increase/decrease next round's policy draw (policy bandwidth shifts).
  - MODIFY_MAX_POLICIES_THIS_ROUND {delta}: change how many policies can be implemented this round.
- For quantitative_indicator: include at least one numeric indicator in the short_description (e.g., "+1.5%" or "3x").
- Valence icons: never show both green and red; use only one direction or neutral.
- arrows_up: 0, 1, or 3 only; arrows_down: 0, 1, or 3 only.
- If valence is positive, use arrows_up (1=slightly positive, 3=very positive) and set arrows_down=0.
- If valence is negative, use arrows_down (1=slightly negative, 3=very negative) and set arrows_up=0.
- If valence is mixed, set arrows_up=0 and arrows_down=0 (neutral line on the card).
- art_prompt should be a concise instruction for a horizontal card illustration (no need to include title text here; it will be added later).
