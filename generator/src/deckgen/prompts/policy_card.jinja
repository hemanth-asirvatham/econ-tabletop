Content constraints:
- Title: 2-4 words, simple and punchy (no subtitle, no colon).
- short_description: <= 60 characters; minimalist summary.
- description: 1 short sentence, <= 140 characters total.
- Use concrete, actionable policy language with a clear lever and target.
- Favor broad, legible titles that capture the policy lever without being overly specific or bureaucratic.
- Titles should make the policy topic obvious to a lay reader (e.g., "Power Line Upgrades" not "Transmission Optimization").
- Ensure titles and short descriptions make the policy action and target unmistakable at a glance.
- Keep descriptions accessible to a smart lay audience; avoid niche jargon without quick clarification.
- Ensure policy content extends beyond AI-adjacent levers into general economic and geopolitical realities influenced by AI:
  healthcare delivery, construction productivity, logistics, housing affordability, trade resilience, and critical infrastructure.
- Keep policy descriptions focused on the broader story and visible real-economy effects, not technical implementation details.
- If the card mentions a numeric parameter (e.g., dollars, %, headcount, unemployment), wrap the key value in **bold** (e.g., **$250B**, **10%**).
- Include explicit costs or tradeoffs in some descriptions (e.g., budgetary burden, energy price impacts, reduced openness).
- When relevant, make power-infrastructure and data-center impacts explicit and realistic.
- political_capital reflects political effort/consensus required (1=easy win, 5=highly contentious).
- Use 4-5 only for truly contentious, nationwide, or rights-limiting policies; 3 is already a high bar.
- Set political_capital across LOW/MED/HIGH (1-2 low, 3 medium, 4-5 high) and avoid always choosing the same level.
- art_prompt must specify an edge-to-edge landscape illustration that fills the entire frame with no empty margins or floating card.

Example policy archetypes to inspire breadth (do NOT copy verbatim; make them distinct and realistic):
- Sovereign Compute Initiative (e.g., invest **$250B** in domestic data centers; allow multiple variants at different values).
- Power Infrastructure Investment.
- Offensive Cyber Capabilities.
- Audit Training Data.
- Ban Automation in X (specific sector or occupation).
- Universal Basic Income (**$X** per month).
- Wealth Tax (**X%**).
- AI Company Tax.
- Targeted employment schemes.
