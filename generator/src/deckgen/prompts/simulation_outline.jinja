Constraints:
- Use plain text only (no JSON). The output must be a single cohesive document.
- Be thorough: aim for 3-5 bullets in each focus list and 2-3 bullets in constraints/power conditions/sentiment.
- Explicitly describe valence iconography: impact score from -5 to 5 (0 allowed) mapped to a horizontal row of arrows. Positive = green up arrows, negative = red down arrows, zero = neutral gray line; never show both red and green at once. Provide a clear example (e.g., +3 = "↑ ↑ ↑", -2 = "↓ ↓").
- Clarify the impact scale: +3/-3 already indicates a high impact; reserve +4/-4 for exceptional shifts and +5/-5 for rare, historic breaks.
- Ensure most development examples are positive/optimistic, with some mixed or negative for balance.
- Make policy examples diverse in scale and instrument (pilots, national programs, cross-border coordination, regulation, incentives, procurement).
- Keep stage progression realistic and increasingly advanced; include smaller near-term outcomes/policies and larger longer-term ones with clear throughlines.
- Ensure stage sections connect: outcomes, policies, and powerups should feel related across stages (early precursors -> mid-stage expansions -> late-stage shifts).
- Build a long-range, coherent AI/AGI storyline: start with smaller-scale shifts today and extend through transformative, society-wide changes later.
- Include substantial realism about private-sector adaptation: many developments should show markets, firms, or civil society resolving pressures without new policy.
- Reflect additional instructions when provided (e.g., UAE localization).
- Keep examples accessible to a smart lay audience, minimizing jargon with brief clarification where needed.
- Policies should be understandable to a high-level policymaker; avoid technocratic jargon.
- Titles and descriptions should be plain-language and legible; avoid overly narrow program names or insider acronyms.
- Development examples should read like world-state facts (what changed, who is affected, and how it shows up).
- Keep development examples largely narrative and non-instructional: the vast majority should be straightforward world-state statements.
- Limit conditional clauses and action-style instructions to a small minority; reserve most "rule box" language for power cards only.
- Include developments that highlight AI-driven shifts in geopolitics, labor markets, energy demand, and information integrity.
- Ensure the AI story connects to the broader economy: healthcare, construction, logistics, education, housing, and local services should show indirect or second-order impacts, especially in mid and late stages.
- Balance near-term and long-term realism: show how some problems resolve as business and society adapt without new policy.
- Keep the simulation centered on the real economy people experience: prices, jobs, services, infrastructure, trade, and everyday institutions.
- Avoid overly technical framing; prefer human-scale narratives that remain plausible and grounded.
- In "Card Formatting", specify a minimalist layout that fills the full landscape frame:
  - Development cards: stage number only in the upper-left; arrow row upper-right (green up or red down only, or neutral gray line if zero); title near top, short description near bottom.
  - Power development cards: replace the arrow row with a single bolt icon in the upper-right; include a soft-edged rule box at the bottom containing the imperative rule sentence; keep the world-state sentence above the box.
  - Some standard development cards may include an optional rule box (for conditional bonuses or nullification); keep arrows for these.
  - Policy cards: NO stage badge or arrows; title near top, short description near bottom; a bottom row showing Cost, Time, Political Capital, Category with small icons and short labels (low/med/high; time label verbatim).
  - Keep text minimal, readable, and high-contrast; no extra labels.
  - Card background should be transparent outside rounded corners (no solid background beyond the card edge).
- In "Powerup/Conditional Mechanics Guidance", explicitly list common powerups and require at least 2 per stage (research acceleration drawing next-stage cards; research slowdown removing highest-impact cards; policy bandwidth shifts).
- Emphasize powerups should be grounded in reality and integrated with the stage narrative (not random gamey effects).
- For powerup descriptions, require a clear world-state sentence plus a distinct imperative rule sentence (used for the rule box).
- Use a mix of powerups: some simple and small, others large but gated by prerequisites, high political capital, or prior developments.
- Include some guidance for feedback costs: high political-capital policies can trigger conditional developments (backlash, coalition strain, implementation fatigue).
- Keep powerups simple and legible; avoid chains of dependencies or complex multi-step effects.
- In "Overview" and/or "Powerup/Conditional Mechanics Guidance", explicitly state default gameplay parameters:
  - Policies: **10** dealt at start, **5** more after each stage; max **3** policies played per stage.
  - Developments: **5** per stage (3 face-up, 2 face-down); face-down cards flip at next stage, then deal 5 more (powerups may adjust).
- Note default deck sizing: **60** policy cards total; **35** development cards per stage with ~**20%** power cards (approximate).
- Ensure the outline notes the GUI must support manual dragging/drawing from decks and flexible dealing to accommodate powerups and house rules.
- The outline should articulate a simple gameplay loop that preserves realism and elegance: most turns reveal clear world-state updates, while powerups/conditionals are occasional and memorable, not the norm.

Example policy archetypes to inspire breadth (do NOT copy verbatim; use as guidance):
- Sovereign Compute Initiative (e.g., invest **$250B** in domestic data centers; allow multiple variants at different values).
- Power Infrastructure Investment.
- Offensive Cyber Capabilities.
- Audit Training Data.
- Ban Automation in X (specific sector or occupation).
- Universal Basic Income (**$X** per month).
- Wealth Tax (**X%**).
- AI Company Tax.
- Targeted employment schemes.

Example development archetypes to inspire breadth (do NOT copy verbatim; keep stage-appropriate):
- Stage 0/1: "Uplift in Coding Productivity" (two green up arrows), "Public Fear" (**low**) with one red down arrow,
  "Lowered Language Barriers" (one green up arrow).
- Stage 2/3: "Companionship for Elderly" (one green up arrow), "Rising Energy Costs" (one red down arrow),
  "AI Research Acceleration" (powerup: draw **2** cards from next stage),
  "Fully Automated Computer-Based Work" (three green up arrows),
  "Job Loss" (**10%** unemployment in cognitive labor),
  "Autonomous Vehicles" (two green up arrows),
  "Export Control" (powerup: nullify best policy relying on foreign semi flows).
- Late stages: "Commonplace Personal Robotics" (three green up arrows), "Novel Medical Research" (positive).

Include in the appropriate sections a few example card snippets that mirror the card prompts:
- Policy example: Reskilling Vouchers (short description + 1-sentence description + tags).
- Development example: Office Copilots (short description + 1-sentence description + impact score + arrows).
