You are writing a single Simulation Outline document that will govern all downstream generation.

Goal: Produce a detailed, well-structured outline with headings and bullet points (plain text only).

Scenario Context (must be woven into the outline):
{{ scenario_injection or "(none)" }}

Stages (authoritative definitions):
{{ stages | tojson }}

Deck sizes:
{{ deck_sizes | tojson }}

Allowed categories:
{{ categories | join(", ") }}

Allowed tags:
{{ tags | join(", ") }}

Mix targets:
{{ mix_targets | tojson }}

Required sections (use these headings verbatim):
1) Overview
2) Stage-by-Stage Outline (one subsection per stage, in order)
3) Policy Variety & Examples
4) Development Card Variety & Examples
5) Powerup/Conditional Mechanics Guidance
6) Card Formatting (policy + development layout, valence iconography)
7) Art Direction (minimalist, lightly impressionist; Victoria 3-style vibe)
8) Generation Guardrails (optimism bias, realism, stage progression)

Stage subsection template (repeat for each stage):
### Stage <N>: <Name>
- Time horizon:
- Capability profile:
- World state:
- AI role:
- Policy focus (bulleted list):
- Development focus (bulleted list):
- Power dynamics (bulleted list):
- Example policy cards (3+ examples, each with Title + 1-2 sentence summary + tags):
- Example development cards (3+ examples with Title + short description + valence arrows, include at least one powerup or conditional):
- Art notes for this stage:

Constraints:
- Use plain text only (no JSON). The output must be a single cohesive document.
- Explicitly describe valence iconography: green up-caret stack (1-3), red down-caret stack (1-3), neutral gray line if zero.
- Ensure most development examples are positive/optimistic, with some mixed or negative for balance.
- Make policy examples diverse in scale and instrument (pilots, national programs, cross-border coordination, regulation, incentives, procurement).
- Keep stage progression realistic and increasingly advanced.
- Reflect scenario context when provided (e.g., UAE localization).
- In "Card Formatting", specify a minimalist layout: title + description only, category badge in a corner, and compact icon chips for cost/impact/timeline using stars or dots (no numbers); for development cards include STAGE badge upper-left and caret stack upper-right, with powerup rules embedded as a short imperative sentence in the description.
- In "Powerup/Conditional Mechanics Guidance", explicitly list common powerups and require at least 2 per stage (research acceleration drawing next-stage cards; research slowdown removing highest-impact cards; policy bandwidth shifts).

Example output (truncated):
# Simulation Outline
1) Overview
- This simulation explores staged AI diffusion across the economy...

2) Stage-by-Stage Outline
### Stage 0: Stage 0
- Time horizon: today / near-term
- Capability profile: Frontier models as copilots
- World state: Early productivity gains appear in office workflows...
- AI role: Assistive copilots and analytics accelerators.
- Policy focus:
  - Workforce reskilling
  - Safety standards
  - Public-sector pilots
- Development focus:
  - Productivity nudges
  - Labor shifts
  - Compute availability
- Power dynamics:
  - Compute bottlenecks can reduce next-round dev draws (MODIFY_DEV_DRAW_NEXT_ROUND -1).
  - Pilots can unlock conditional cards tied to public-sector tags.
- Example policy cards:
  - Reskilling Vouchers — Targeted vouchers for mid-career workers. Tags: workforce_reskilling
  - AI Audit Liability Regime — Mandatory audits for high-risk models. Tags: safety_standards
  - Compute Procurement Sandbox — Government pre-buys compute capacity for SMEs. Tags: compute_access
- Example development cards:
  - Copilots Spread Across Office Work — Early productivity gains (+1.2%); Valence: ↑↑ (mixed with tradeoffs). Tags: productivity_growth
  - Public Service Copilot Rollout — Case backlog drops 15%; Valence: ↑↑↑ (positive). Powerup: DRAW_DEV_NOW +1.
  - Chip Supply Pinch — Deployment delays in regulated sectors; Valence: ↓ (negative). Conditional: requires compute_policy tags.
- Art notes for this stage: Minimalist office skyline, muted teal and sand palette.
