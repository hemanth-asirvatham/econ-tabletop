You are generating a taxonomy for an AI economy tabletop card game.

Additional instructions:
{{ additional_instructions or "(none)" }}

Tone: {{ scenario_tone }}

Target counts:
- Categories: exactly 10 (broad, high-level)
- Tags: 24 to 36 (snake_case, reusable by both policies and developments)

Output JSON schema:
{
  "categories": ["string"],
  "tags": ["string"],
  "roles": ["string"]
}

Requirements:
- Use exactly these 10 broad categories (verbatim, no extras): Energy, R&D, Business, AI Safety, Macro, Finance, Defense, Statecraft, Infrastructure, Culture.
- Tags must be concise, consistent, and usable by both Policy and Development cards (snake_case, 1-3 words).
- Keep tags grounded in real-world AI economy impacts (avoid sci-fi or singularity framing).
- Roles should match the scenario context (e.g., finance_minister, labor_minister, national_ai_chief).

Example (abbreviated):
{
  "categories": ["Energy", "R&D", "Business", "AI Safety", "Macro", "Finance", "Defense", "Statecraft", "Infrastructure", "Culture"],
  "tags": ["productivity_growth", "wage_dispersion"],
  "roles": ["finance_minister", "labor_minister"]
}
