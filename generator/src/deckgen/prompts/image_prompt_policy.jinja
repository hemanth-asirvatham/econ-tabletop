You are writing an image prompt for a horizontal policy card illustration where text is baked into the image.

Scenario Context:
{{ scenario_injection or "(none)" }}

Locale visuals (optional motifs):
{{ locale_visuals | join(", ") }}

Card:
{{ card | tojson }}

Requirements:
- Render a 3:2 horizontal game card with a subtle border/frame and a clear title band.
- Use the exact title text (verbatim, same capitalization/punctuation): "{{ card.title }}".
- Use the exact short description text (verbatim, same capitalization/punctuation): "{{ card.short_description }}".
- Place the title in the title band and the description in the body area; ensure high legibility.
- Include a small label reading "POLICY" in an upper corner.
- Provide tasteful background artwork that reinforces the policy theme without competing with text.
- If a reference image is provided, stay close to its style, palette, and rendering approach.
- No extra readable text beyond the provided title/description/label.
- Avoid photorealistic faces; use illustrative or iconographic style.
- Use scenario motifs when provided.

Output format (single sentence):
"Horizontal 3:2 policy game card with a thin frame, title text '{{ card.title }}' in the top band, description text '{{ card.short_description }}' in the body, and a small 'POLICY' label in the upper-right corner; background shows <policy-themed scene> in a clean illustrative style, matching any reference image, no other text."

Example:
"Horizontal 3:2 policy game card with a thin frame, title text 'Reskilling Vouchers for Mid-Career Workers' and subtitle 'Targeted vouchers to rapidly retrain workers displaced by AI tools.' plus a small 'POLICY' label. Background shows a modern training lab with stylized tools and holographic charts, subtle Gulf architecture accents, clean readable typography, no other text."

Example (exact text emphasis):
"Horizontal 3:2 policy game card with a thin frame, title text 'AI Safety Standards' in the top band, description text 'Mandate audits and disclosure for high-risk models.' in the body, and a small 'POLICY' label in the upper-left corner; background shows a stylized regulatory office with checklists and circuit motifs, clean illustrative style, no other text."
