Create a 3:2 horizontal POLICY card illustration with baked-in text and full card frame.

Scenario context: {{ scenario_injection or "(none)" }}
Locale visuals (optional motifs): {{ locale_visuals | join(", ") }}
Card format notes (concise): {{ image_outline_text }}

Title (verbatim): "{{ card.title }}"
Description (verbatim): "{{ card.description }}"
Impact score: {{ card.impact_score }}/5
Budget level: {{ card.cost.budget_level }}/5
Time to impact: {{ card.timeline.time_to_impact }}
Category (verbatim): "{{ card.category }}"

Layout & styling:
- Render the entire card with rounded corners, subtle bevel, and a thin outer border; the card should fill nearly the full frame with a small white margin behind it.
- Use a refined tabletop-card layout like a premium board-game card; crisp typography and precise alignment.
- Keep the layout minimalist: a single title line and a single description block only (no repeated titles, no extra labels).
- Place the title in a clean top band; place the description in the central body with high legibility and proper line breaks.
- Add a small category badge in one corner using the Category text verbatim.
- Add three compact icon chips in a single corner or edge strip: money icon + filled stars/dots for budget level (no numbers), impact icon + filled stars/dots for impact score (no numbers), clock icon + short time-to-impact text (e.g., "TIME 1-2y").
- Do not display implementation complexity anywhere.
- Place an illustrative scene panel or full-background motif that matches the theme, with a Victoria 3 impressionist art style unless the card format notes override it.
- Use rich color but keep UI elements high-contrast; no photorealism; elegant texture.
- Only show the specified text/labels; no extra readable text. Ensure perfect text rendering.
