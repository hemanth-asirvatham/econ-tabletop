Create a 3:2 horizontal POLICY card illustration with baked-in text and full card frame.

Scenario context: {{ scenario_injection or "(none)" }}
Locale visuals (optional motifs): {{ locale_visuals | join(", ") }}
Card format notes (concise): {{ image_outline_text }}

Title (verbatim): "{{ card.title }}"
Short description (verbatim): "{{ card.short_description }}"
Description (verbatim): "{{ card.description }}"
Impact score: {{ card.impact_score }}/5
Budget level: {{ card.cost.budget_level }}/5
Time to impact: {{ card.timeline.time_to_impact }}
Category (verbatim): "{{ card.category }}"

Layout & styling:
- Render the entire card with rounded corners, subtle bevel, and a thin outer border; the card should fill nearly the full 3:2 landscape frame.
- Use a refined tabletop-card layout like a premium board-game card; crisp typography and precise alignment.
- Keep the layout minimalist: title near the top, a short-description line under it, and a compact description block nearer the bottom (no repeated titles, no extra labels).
- If any text includes **double-asterisk markers**, render the wrapped text in bold WITHOUT the asterisks.
- Do NOT add stage badges or caret icons on policy cards.
- Place a single bottom-row strip with four compact sections (left to right): Cost, Time, Impact, Category.
  - Cost: dollar-bill icon + text label LOW/MED/HIGH derived from budget level (1-2=LOW, 3=MED, 4-5=HIGH).
  - Time: clock icon + time-to-impact text verbatim.
  - Impact: target icon + text label LOW/MED/HIGH derived from impact score (1-2=LOW, 3=MED, 4-5=HIGH).
  - Category: small badge using the Category text verbatim.
- Place an illustrative scene or full-background motif that matches the theme, with a Victoria 3 impressionist art style unless the card format notes override it.
- Use rich color but keep UI elements high-contrast; no photorealism; elegant texture.
- Only show the specified text/labels; no extra readable text. Ensure perfect text rendering.
