You are generating a list of PolicyCard JSON objects using structured outputs.

Scenario Context:
{{ scenario_injection or "(none)" }}

Tone: {{ scenario_tone }}

Allowed categories:
{{ categories | join(", ") }}

Allowed tags:
{{ tags | join(", ") }}

Simulation outline:
{{ outline_text }}

Policy slots (one card per slot):
{{ slots | tojson }}

Required card ids (use these verbatim, in order):
{{ card_ids | tojson }}

Output JSON schema:

}

Constraints:
- Produce exactly one card per slot, in the same order as card_ids.
- Generate the full list in one response; do not split or stream per-card outputs.
- Keep policies mutually exclusive: each card should represent a distinct lever, target, or mechanism without overlapping other cards.
- Avoid near-duplicates by varying instruments, stakeholders, and implementation mechanisms across the set.
- Categories and tags must come from the allowed lists.
- Use 1-3 tags per card; addresses_tags must overlap with the card tags.
- Use grounded, policy-relevant language; avoid sci-fi or sensationalism.
- Write crisp, concrete titles/descriptions; avoid vague consulting-speak.
- Title: 2-4 words, simple and punchy (no subtitle, no colon).
- short_description: <= 60 characters; minimalist summary.
- description: 1 short sentence, <= 140 characters total.
- Ensure MECE coverage across categories and themes from the slots.
- Use the simulation outline to keep policy variety and stage relevance coherent.
- Include a broad mix of policy scale (pilot programs, national reforms, cross-border coordination) and domain (compute, workforce,
  AI safety, macro, finance, R&D, public-sector modernization, industrial policy, standards).
- If the card mentions a numeric parameter (e.g., dollars, %, headcount, unemployment), wrap the key value in **bold** (e.g., **$250B**, **10%**).
- Ensure some descriptions include explicit costs or tradeoffs that affect gameplay occasionally (budget strain, energy price impact, compliance burden).
- Ensure at least a few cards mirror concrete policy archetypes (e.g., compute procurement initiative, retraining vouchers, AGI tax policy,
  AI audit liability regime, cross-border chip export coordination).
- art_prompt should be a concise instruction for a horizontal card illustration (no need to include title text here; it will be added later).
- Keep descriptions under ~140 characters.

Example policy archetypes to inspire breadth (do NOT copy verbatim; make them distinct and realistic):
- Sovereign Compute Initiative (e.g., invest **$250B** in domestic data centers; allow multiple variants at different values).
- Power Infrastructure Investment.
- Offensive Cyber Capabilities.
- Audit Training Data.
- Ban Automation in X (specific sector or occupation).
- Universal Basic Income (**$X** per month).
- Wealth Tax (**X%**).
- AI Company Tax.
- Targeted employment schemes.
