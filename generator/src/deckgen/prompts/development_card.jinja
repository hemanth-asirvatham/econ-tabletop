Effects vocabulary (use when needed, especially for powerups):
- DRAW_DEV_NOW {count, stage_offset}: immediately reveal additional development cards this round.
- DRAW_DEV_NEXT_STAGE_NOW {count}: immediately reveal cards from the next stage.
- MODIFY_DEV_DRAW_NEXT_ROUND {delta}: increase/decrease next round's development draw (research acceleration/slowdown).
- MODIFY_POLICY_DRAW_NEXT_ROUND {delta}: increase/decrease next round's policy draw (policy bandwidth shifts).
- MODIFY_MAX_POLICIES_THIS_ROUND {delta}: change how many policies can be implemented this round.
