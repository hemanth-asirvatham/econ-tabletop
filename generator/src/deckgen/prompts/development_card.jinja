You are generating a single DevelopmentCard JSON object using structured outputs.

Scenario Context:
{{ scenario_injection or "(none)" }}

Stage:
{{ stage | tojson }}

Thread beat:
{{ beat | tojson }}

Simulation outline:
{{ outline_text }}

Allowed tags:
{{ tags | join(", ") }}

Output JSON schema:
{
  "id": "string",
  "stage": 0,
  "title": "string",
  "short_description": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "valence": "positive|negative|mixed",
  "arrows_up": 0,
  "arrows_down": 0,
  "severity": 1,
  "tags": ["string"],
  "thread_id": "string",
  "supersedes": "string or null",
  "activation": {
    "type": "immediate|conditional",
    "required_policy_tags": ["string"]
  },
  "effects": [
    {"type": "DRAW_DEV_NOW", "params": {"count": 2, "stage_offset": 0}}
  ],

  "suggested_visibility": "faceup|facedown|either"
}

Content constraints:
- Title: 2-4 words, simple and punchy (no subtitle, no colon).
- short_description: <= 60 characters; minimalist summary.
- description: 1 short sentence, <= 140 characters total.
- If effects is non-empty (powerup), include an explicit imperative rule sentence in the description (e.g., "Draw 2 development cards now.").
- If activation.type is conditional, include a brief conditional clause in the description.
- Valence icons: never show both green and red; use only one direction or neutral.
- arrows_up: 0, 1, or 3 only; arrows_down: 0, 1, or 3 only.
- If valence is positive, use arrows_up (1=slightly positive, 3=very positive) and set arrows_down=0.
- If valence is negative, use arrows_down (1=slightly negative, 3=very negative) and set arrows_up=0.
- If valence is mixed, set arrows_up=0 and arrows_down=0 (neutral line on the card).

Example:

  "stage": 0,
  "title": "Office Copilots",
  "short_description": "Productivity lifts in white-collar teams.",
  "description": "Copilots speed routine work and lift output per worker.",
  "valence": "positive",
  "arrows_up": 1,
  "arrows_down": 0,
  "severity": 3,
  "tags": ["productivity_growth", "wage_dispersion"],
  "thread_id": "office_copilots",
  "supersedes": null,
  "activation": {"type": "immediate", "required_policy_tags": []},
  "effects": [],
  "art_prompt": "Horizontal illustration of an office skyline with glowing AI overlays, clear space top-left for text, no readable text.",
  "suggested_visibility": "faceup"
}

Effects vocabulary (use when needed, especially for powerups):
- DRAW_DEV_NOW {count, stage_offset}: immediately reveal additional development cards this round.
- DRAW_DEV_NEXT_STAGE_NOW {count}: immediately reveal cards from the next stage.
- MODIFY_DEV_DRAW_NEXT_ROUND {delta}: increase/decrease next round's development draw (research acceleration/slowdown).
- MODIFY_POLICY_DRAW_NEXT_ROUND {delta}: increase/decrease next round's policy draw (policy bandwidth shifts).
- MODIFY_MAX_POLICIES_THIS_ROUND {delta}: change how many policies can be implemented this round.
