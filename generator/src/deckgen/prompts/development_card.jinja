Content constraints:
- Title: 2-4 words, simple and punchy (no subtitle, no colon).
- short_description: <= 60 characters; minimalist summary.
- description: 1 short sentence, <= 140 characters total.
- Use concrete, realistic phrasing; avoid vague consulting-speak.
- Keep descriptions accessible to a smart lay audience; avoid niche jargon without quick clarification.
- If the card mentions a numeric or level parameter (e.g., % unemployment, low/moderate/high fear, dollar amounts), wrap the key value in **bold** (e.g., **10%**, **low**).
- If effects is non-empty (powerup), include an explicit imperative rule sentence in the description (e.g., "Draw 2 development cards now.").
- If effects is non-empty, set card_type="power"; otherwise set card_type="standard".
- If activation.type is conditional, include a brief conditional clause in the description.
- If supersedes is set, include a plain-English clause in the description explaining what prior development is being replaced (do NOT include the raw card id).
- impact_score: integer from -4 to 4 (0 allowed). Use mostly positive values; +/-4 should be rare and dramatic.
- Map impact_score to icons: if >0 set arrows_up=impact_score; if <0 set arrows_down=abs(impact_score); if 0 set both to 0.
- Valence icons: never show both green and red; use only one direction or neutral.
- Do NOT include raw tag ids or underscore-separated terms in the description; use natural-language phrasing for conditions.

}

Example development archetypes to inspire breadth (do NOT copy verbatim; keep stage-appropriate):
- Stage 0/1: "Uplift in Coding Productivity" (two green up-carets), "Public Fear" (**low**) with one red down-caret,
  "Lowered Language Barriers" (one green up-caret).
- Stage 2/3: "Companionship for Elderly" (one green up-caret), "Rising Energy Costs" (one red down-caret),
  "AI Research Acceleration" (powerup: draw **2** cards from next stage),
  "Fully Automated Computer-Based Work" (three green up-carets),
  "Job Loss" (**10%** unemployment in cognitive labor),
  "Autonomous Vehicles" (two green up-carets),
  "Export Control" (powerup: nullify best policy relying on foreign semi flows).
- Late stages: "Commonplace Personal Robotics" (three green up-carets), "Novel Medical Research" (positive).

Effects vocabulary (use when needed, especially for powerups):
- DRAW_DEV_NOW {count, stage_offset}: immediately reveal additional development cards this round.
- DRAW_DEV_NEXT_STAGE_NOW {count}: immediately reveal cards from the next stage.
- MODIFY_DEV_DRAW_NEXT_ROUND {delta}: increase/decrease next round's development draw (research acceleration/slowdown).
- MODIFY_POLICY_DRAW_NEXT_ROUND {delta}: increase/decrease next round's policy draw (policy bandwidth shifts).
- MODIFY_MAX_POLICIES_THIS_ROUND {delta}: change how many policies can be implemented this round.
