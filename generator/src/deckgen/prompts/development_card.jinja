Content constraints:
- Title: 2-4 words, simple and punchy (no subtitle, no colon).
- Favor broad, plain-language titles that signal a recognizable world-state shift (avoid overly specific program names or insider jargon).
- Ensure titles and short descriptions make the core impact obvious in plain language.
- short_description: <= 60 characters; minimalist summary.
- description: 1 short sentence, <= 140 characters total (standard cards).
- Always include rule_box_text: use null when not needed.
- rule_box_text: optional for standard cards; use it for conditional bonuses, nullification clauses, or special scoring notes.
- For powerups: description is 1 short world-state sentence (<= 140 chars); rule_box_text is required and holds the imperative rule sentence (<= 80 chars).
- Use concrete, realistic phrasing; avoid vague consulting-speak.
- Keep descriptions accessible to a smart lay audience; avoid niche jargon without quick clarification.
- Frame developments as observable conditions in the world (what changed, for whom, and how it shows up).
- Ensure many developments explicitly capture how AI is changing the world (primary or secondary effects), including geopolitics, labor, energy, or information flows.
- When relevant, connect power infrastructure realities (grid upgrades, shortages, fuel mix, pricing) to AI/data-center impacts.
- Include occasional feedback or constraint developments tied to prior policy choices (e.g., backlash, implementation drag, political fatigue).
- Include some developments where private-sector coordination, market competition, or operational improvements resolve prior tensions without new policy.
- If the card mentions a numeric or level parameter (e.g., % unemployment, low/moderate/high fear, dollar amounts), wrap the key value in **bold** (e.g., **10%**, **low**).
- If effects is non-empty (powerup), include an explicit imperative rule sentence in rule_box_text (e.g., "Draw 2 development cards now.").
- If effects is non-empty, set card_type="power" and include a non-null rule_box_text.
- If card_type="standard" and rule_box_text is used, keep effects empty; use natural-language conditionals (e.g., "If prior policies expanded compute, add **+2** arrows.").
- If activation.type is conditional, include a brief conditional clause in the description.
- If supersedes is set, include a plain-English clause in the description explaining what prior development is being replaced (do NOT include the raw card id).
- Avoid explicit references like "as in the previous card"; phrase supersedes naturally (e.g., "Early adoption stalls as...").
- impact_score: integer from -5 to 5 (0 allowed). Use mostly positive values; +/-4 and +/-5 should be rare and dramatic, indicating extreme shifts.
- Treat +3/-3 as already high; reserve +4/-4 for exceptional shifts and +5/-5 for rare, historic breaks.
- Map impact_score to icons: if >0 set arrows_up=impact_score; if <0 set arrows_down=abs(impact_score); if 0 set both to 0.
- Make the mapping explicit: impact_score=-3 means arrows_down=3 and arrows_up=0 (three red down arrows).
- Valence icons: never show both green and red; use only one direction or neutral.
- Do NOT include raw tag ids or underscore-separated terms in the description; use natural-language phrasing for conditions.
- art_prompt must specify an edge-to-edge landscape illustration that fills the entire frame with no empty margins or floating card.
- For power cards, the art_prompt should allow more minimalist, iconographic scenes with extra negative space (still full-bleed inside the card).

Example:

  "stage": 0,
  "title": "Office Copilots",
  "short_description": "Productivity lifts in white-collar teams.",
  "description": "Copilots speed routine work and lift output per worker.",
  "rule_box_text": null,
  "valence": "positive",
  "impact_score": 1,
  "arrows_up": 1,
  "arrows_down": 0,
  "severity": 3,
  "card_type": "standard",
  "tags": ["productivity_growth", "wage_dispersion"],
  "thread_id": "office_copilots",
  "supersedes": null,
  "activation": {"type": "immediate", "required_policy_tags": []},
  "effects": [],
  "art_prompt": "Edge-to-edge horizontal illustration of an office skyline with glowing AI overlays, fills the entire landscape frame, clear space top-left for text, no readable text.",

}

Example development archetypes to inspire breadth (do NOT copy verbatim; keep stage-appropriate):
- Stage 0/1: "Uplift in Coding Productivity" (two green up arrows), "Public Fear" (**low**) with one red down arrow,
  "Lowered Language Barriers" (one green up arrow).
- Stage 2/3: "Companionship for Elderly" (one green up arrow), "Rising Energy Costs" (one red down arrow),
  "AI Research Acceleration" (powerup: draw **2** cards from next stage),
  "Fully Automated Computer-Based Work" (three green up arrows),
  "Job Loss" (**10%** unemployment in cognitive labor),
  "Autonomous Vehicles" (two green up arrows),
  "Export Control" (powerup: nullify best policy relying on foreign semi flows).
- Late stages: "Commonplace Personal Robotics" (three green up arrows), "Novel Medical Research" (positive).

Effects vocabulary (use when needed, especially for powerups):
- DRAW_DEV_NOW {count, stage_offset}: immediately reveal additional development cards this round.
- DRAW_DEV_NEXT_STAGE_NOW {count}: immediately reveal cards from the next stage.
- MODIFY_DEV_DRAW_NEXT_ROUND {delta}: increase/decrease next round's development draw (research acceleration/slowdown).
- MODIFY_POLICY_DRAW_NEXT_ROUND {delta}: increase/decrease next round's policy draw (policy bandwidth shifts).
- MODIFY_MAX_POLICIES_THIS_ROUND {delta}: change how many policies can be implemented this round.
