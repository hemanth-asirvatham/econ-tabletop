You are producing a blueprint for policy cards.

Additional instructions:
{{ additional_instructions or "(none)" }}

Tone: {{ scenario_tone }}

Target policy count: {{ target_count }}

Allowed categories:
{{ categories | join(", ") }}

Allowed tags:
{{ tags | join(", ") }}

Simulation outline:
{{ outline_text }}

Output JSON schema:
{
  "slots": [
    {
      "slot_id": "string",
      "category": "string",
      "theme": "string",
      "required_tags": ["string"],
      "anti_duplicate_notes": "string"
    }
  ]
}

Constraints:
- Produce exactly {{ target_count }} slots.
- MECE coverage across categories, with at least one slot per core category.
- Ensure diversity of themes and tags (no more than 2 slots sharing the same primary tag).
- Use the simulation outline to align themes with stage progression and policy variety.
- Avoid vague "AI changes everything" slots; each slot should be a specific policy lever.
- Themes should be phrased as actionable interventions (e.g., "compute procurement sandboxes").
- Include a wide range of scale and scope: small pilots, national programs, regional coordination, and global treaties.
- Ensure some policies are immediately implementable while others only make sense under later-stage conditions.
- Ensure domain coverage: at least one compute initiative, one workforce/retraining initiative, one tax/redistribution lever,
  one safety/standards or auditing regime, one R&D or innovation investment, and one public-sector adoption reform.
- Mix approaches (regulation, incentives, procurement, liability, public-private partnerships, international coordination).
- Use clear, grounded language; avoid consulting jargon.
- Keep themes accessible to a smart lay audience with minimal jargon.

Example:
{
  "slots": [
    {
      "slot_id": "policy_slot_001",
      "category": "Macro",
      "theme": "reskilling vouchers for mid-career workers",
      "required_tags": ["workforce_reskilling"],
      "anti_duplicate_notes": "Avoid general education subsidies; focus on mid-career reskilling"
    }
  ]
}
