You are writing an image prompt for a horizontal development card illustration where text is baked into the image.

Scenario Context:
{{ scenario_injection or "(none)" }}

Locale visuals (optional motifs):
{{ locale_visuals | join(", ") }}

Card:
{{ card | tojson }}

Requirements:
- Render a 3:2 horizontal game card with a subtle border/frame and a clear title band.
- Use the exact title text (verbatim, same capitalization/punctuation): "{{ card.title }}".
- Use the exact short description text (verbatim, same capitalization/punctuation): "{{ card.short_description }}".
- Place the title in the title band and the description in the body area; ensure high legibility.
- Include a small label reading "OUTCOME" (or "DEVELOPMENT") in an upper corner.
- Include small up/down arrow icons matching arrows_up={{ card.arrows_up }} and arrows_down={{ card.arrows_down }}.
- Place the arrows in a lower corner or margin so they do not overlap text.
- Provide minimalist background artwork that reinforces the development theme without competing with text.
- Keep the style consistent across cards: modern, clean, minimal, lots of negative space.
- Use a restrained palette (2–3 muted colors), soft gradients, and thin line icons or geometric shapes.
- If a reference image is provided, stay close to its style, palette, and rendering approach.
- No extra readable text beyond the provided title/description/label.
- Avoid photorealism; use flat or lightly shaded illustration.
- Use scenario motifs when provided.

Output format (single sentence):
"Horizontal 3:2 development game card with a thin frame, title text '{{ card.title }}' in the top band, description text '{{ card.short_description }}' in the body, a small 'OUTCOME' label in the upper-left corner, and {{ card.arrows_up }} green up arrows plus {{ card.arrows_down }} red down arrows in the lower-right; background shows a minimalist <development-themed motif> with thin line icons, muted palette, generous whitespace, matching any reference image, no other text."
