Create a 3:2 horizontal DEVELOPMENT card illustration with baked-in text and full card frame.

Scenario context: {{ scenario_injection or "(none)" }}
Locale visuals (optional motifs): {{ locale_visuals | join(", ") }}
Card format notes (concise): {{ image_outline_text }}

Title (verbatim): "{{ card.title }}"
Description (verbatim): "{{ card.description }}"
Stage label: "STAGE {{ card.stage }}"
Arrows up/down: {{ card.arrows_up }} up, {{ card.arrows_down }} down
Severity: {{ card.severity }}/5

Layout & styling:
- Render the entire card with rounded corners, subtle bevel, and a thin outer border; the card should fill nearly the full frame with a small white margin behind it.
- Use a refined tabletop-card layout like a premium board-game card; crisp typography and precise alignment.
- Keep the layout minimalist: a single title line and a single description block only (no repeated titles, no extra labels).
- Place the title in a clean top band; place the description in the central body with high legibility and proper line breaks.
- If the description includes an imperative rule sentence (e.g., "Draw 2 cards next stage."), render that sentence as a subtle rule line within the description block (still plain text, no extra labels).
- Place "STAGE {{ card.stage }}" in the upper-left corner as a small badge.
- In the upper-right corner, show stacked caret icons: {{ card.arrows_up }} green up-carets and {{ card.arrows_down }} red down-carets; if both are zero, use a single neutral gray line.
- Include a small severity indicator (SEVERITY) with filled dots or bars matching the score above.
- Place an illustrative scene panel or full-background motif that matches the theme, with a Victoria 3 impressionist art style unless the card format notes override it.
- Use rich color but keep UI elements high-contrast; no photorealism; elegant texture.
- Only show the specified text/labels; no extra readable text. Ensure perfect text rendering.
