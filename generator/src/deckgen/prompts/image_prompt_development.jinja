Create a 3:2 horizontal DEVELOPMENT card illustration with baked-in text and full card frame.

Additional instructions: {{ additional_instructions or "(none)" }}
Locale visuals (optional motifs): {{ locale_visuals | join(", ") }}
Card format notes (concise): {{ image_outline_text }}

Title (verbatim): "{{ card.title }}"
Short description (verbatim): "{{ card.short_description }}"
Description (verbatim): "{{ card.description }}"
Rule box text (verbatim): "{{ card.rule_box_text }}"
Stage label: "{{ card.stage }}"
Impact score: {{ card.impact_score }} (map to arrow count)
Arrows up/down: {{ card.arrows_up }} up, {{ card.arrows_down }} down
Card type: {{ card.card_type }}

Layout & styling:
- Render the entire card with rounded corners, subtle bevel, and a thin outer border; the card should fill the 3:2 landscape frame edge-to-edge with no empty margin.
- The area outside the rounded card corners must be transparent (alpha), not a solid background.
- Use a refined tabletop-card layout like a premium board-game card; crisp typography and precise alignment.
- Keep the layout minimalist: stage number in the upper-left, title near the top, a short-description line under it, and a compact description block nearer the bottom (no repeated titles, no extra labels).
- If card_type is "power", place the world-state sentence in the description block, and place the imperative rule sentence from rule_box_text into a soft-edged rule box at the very bottom.
- If rule_box_text is present on a standard card, render the same rule box at the very bottom while keeping the arrow row visible.
- If rule_box_text is present on a standard card, keep the overall development-card layout and integrate a power-style rule box without changing the rest of the style.
- If rule_box_text is empty or null, do not render a rule box.
- Render the rule box with rounded corners, a light fill, and subtle border; keep the rule text short and centered.
- If any text includes **double-asterisk markers**, render the wrapped text in bold WITHOUT the asterisks.
- Place the stage number only (e.g., "2") in the upper-left corner as a small badge.
- In the upper-right corner, show a horizontal row of minimalist arrow icons (side-by-side, not stacked) for standard cards only. The count must match the impact score magnitude exactly ({{ card.impact_score }}): use green up arrows for positive and red down arrows for negative. If impact score is zero, use a single neutral gray line "—".
- Use the literal arrow glyphs to convey shape: ↑ ↑ ↑ (for 3 up), ↓ ↓ (for 2 down), — (for zero).
- If card_type is "power", replace the arrow row with a single bolt icon in the upper-right. Add a subtle power accent (e.g., faint glow border). No extra text labels.
- Place an illustrative scene panel or full-background motif that matches the theme, with a Victoria 3 impressionist art style unless the card format notes override it.
- Power cards can be more minimalist, with more negative space and a slightly simpler motif, while still filling the card frame.
- Use rich color but keep UI elements high-contrast; no photorealism; elegant texture.
- Only show the specified text/labels (stage number, title, short description, description, arrow row or bolt icon, rule box text if power); no extra readable text. Ensure perfect text rendering.
