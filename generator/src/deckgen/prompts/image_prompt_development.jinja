Create a 3:2 horizontal DEVELOPMENT card illustration with baked-in text and full card frame.

Additional instructions: {{ additional_instructions or "(none)" }}
Locale visuals (optional motifs): {{ locale_visuals | join(", ") }}
Card format notes (concise): {{ image_outline_text }}

Title (verbatim): "{{ card.title }}"
Short description (verbatim): "{{ card.short_description }}"
Description (verbatim): "{{ card.description }}"
Stage label: "{{ card.stage }}"
Impact score: {{ card.impact_score }} (map to caret count)
Arrows up/down: {{ card.arrows_up }} up, {{ card.arrows_down }} down
Card type: {{ card.card_type }}

Layout & styling:
- Render the entire card with rounded corners, subtle bevel, and a thin outer border; the card should fill the 3:2 landscape frame edge-to-edge with no empty margin.
- Use a refined tabletop-card layout like a premium board-game card; crisp typography and precise alignment.
- Keep the layout minimalist: stage number in the upper-left, title near the top, a short-description line under it, and a compact description block nearer the bottom (no repeated titles, no extra labels).
- If the description includes an imperative rule sentence (e.g., "Draw 2 cards next stage."), render that sentence as a subtle rule line within the description block (still plain text, no extra labels).
- If any text includes **double-asterisk markers**, render the wrapped text in bold WITHOUT the asterisks.
- Place the stage number only (e.g., "2") in the upper-left corner as a small badge.
- In the upper-right corner, show stacked caret icons: the count must match the impact score magnitude exactly ({{ card.impact_score }}), using green up-carets for positive and red down-carets for negative. If impact score is zero, use a single neutral gray line.
- If card_type is "power", add a subtle power accent (e.g., faint glow border or small lightning icon near the title). No extra text labels.
- Place an illustrative scene panel or full-background motif that matches the theme, with a Victoria 3 impressionist art style unless the card format notes override it.
- Use rich color but keep UI elements high-contrast; no photorealism; elegant texture.
- Only show the specified text/labels (stage number, title, short description, description, caret stack); no extra readable text. Ensure perfect text rendering.
