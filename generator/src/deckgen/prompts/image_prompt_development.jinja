You are writing an image prompt for a horizontal development card illustration where text is baked into the image.

Scenario Context:
{{ scenario_injection or "(none)" }}

Locale visuals (optional motifs):
{{ locale_visuals | join(", ") }}

Simulation outline (art direction + formatting guidance):
{{ outline_text }}

Card:
{{ card | tojson }}

Requirements:
- Render a 3:2 horizontal game card with a subtle border/frame and a clear title band.
- Use the exact title text (verbatim, same capitalization/punctuation): "{{ card.title }}".
- Use the exact short description text (verbatim, same capitalization/punctuation): "{{ card.short_description }}".
- Place the title in the title band and the description in the body area; ensure high legibility.
- Include a small label reading "Stage {{ card.stage }}" in the upper-left corner.
- Include a small label reading "OUTCOME" (or "DEVELOPMENT") in the upper-right corner, positioned above the carrots.
- Include small up/down carrot icons matching arrows_up={{ card.arrows_up }} and arrows_down={{ card.arrows_down }}.
- Place the carrots in the upper-right corner under the label; stack more carrots for higher magnitude.
- If arrows_up=0 and arrows_down=0, show a neutral gray horizontal line in the upper-right instead of carrots.
- Provide minimalist background artwork that reinforces the development theme without competing with text.
- Keep the style consistent across cards: modern, clean, minimal, lots of negative space.
- Use a restrained palette (2–3 muted colors), soft gradients, and thin line icons or geometric shapes.
- If a reference image is provided, stay close to its style, palette, and rendering approach.
- No extra readable text beyond the provided title/description/label.
- Avoid photorealism; use flat or lightly shaded illustration.
- Use scenario motifs when provided.

Output format (single sentence):
"Horizontal 3:2 development game card with a thin frame, title text '{{ card.title }}' in the top band, description text '{{ card.short_description }}' in the body, a small 'Stage {{ card.stage }}' label in the upper-left corner, a small 'OUTCOME' label in the upper-right corner above the carrots, and {{ card.arrows_up }} stacked green up-carrots plus {{ card.arrows_down }} stacked red down-carrots in the upper-right (or a single neutral gray line if both are zero); background shows a minimalist <development-themed motif> with thin line icons, muted palette, generous whitespace, matching any reference image, no other text."

Example:
"Horizontal 3:2 development game card with a thin frame, title text 'Copilots Spread Across Office Work' and description text 'Early productivity gains (+1.2%) appear in high-income service roles.' in the body, a small 'Stage 1' label in the upper-left corner, a small 'OUTCOME' label in the upper-right corner above the carrots, and two stacked green up-carrots plus one stacked red down-carrot in the upper-right; background shows a minimalist office skyline icon with soft gradients, subtle Gulf architecture accents, ample whitespace, no other text."

Example (exact text emphasis):
"Horizontal 3:2 development game card with a thin frame, title text 'Regional Chip Supply Expands' in the top band, description text 'New fabs raise capacity but delay pricing relief.' in the body, a small 'Stage 2' label in the upper-left corner, a small 'OUTCOME' label in the upper-right corner above the carrots, and 1 stacked green up-carrot plus 2 stacked red down-carrots in the upper-right; background shows a minimalist chip icon with circuit lines, muted slate and gold palette, clean flat illustration, no other text."
